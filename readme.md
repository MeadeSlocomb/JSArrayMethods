>Reinventing the JS wheel

This repo contains my reconstruction of 3 basic JS methods: .map, .reduce and .filter.

This was an excellent exercise in sharpening my vanilla JS skills and helped me gain a deeper understanding of how complex functionality is accomplished by layering library on top of library.  It's easy to lose sight of this when using high-level frameworks like Jquery or Angular.
